This Website was created for an assignment I had for a Web Developement class. 
It is a website that sells VR Headsets and VR Games. There isn't a cart feature or a way to buy anything because it's mostly static pages. 
My role in the project was to do the majority of the HTML and CSS. I did this because because I enjoyed problem solving how I would use CSS to recreate our teams wireframes designs. 
The website is hosted on this link: https://vrtechbyjsndm123456789.on.drv.tw/www.vr-tech.com/
